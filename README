This is an inkscape extension to handle using layers in multiple pages, mostly
useful with cards. To install, the files named cards.inx and cards.py need to
be in the inkscape extension dir (on Ubuntu: /usr/share/inkscape/extension).
The extension should then (upon restart) be available in the menu
extensions/export/cards...

A Makefile is also available to generate a pdf with all the pages. To use it,
you first need to install "librsvg2-bin" and to set the variable at the start
of the file.

See https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/490643/making-cards-youll-never-use-your-old-method-again
to know how to print on cards. If you print on both side of cardboard, you
should draw it so that cards side match by folding on long edge.

The extension is hardcoded with Linux in mind and need changes to fit on
Windows, perhaps OSx also.
