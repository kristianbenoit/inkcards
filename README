This is an inkscape extension to handle using layers in multiple pages, mostly
useful with cards. To install, the files named cards.inx and cards.py need to
be in the inkscape extension dir (on Ubuntu: /usr/share/inkscape/extension).
The extension should then (upon restart) be available in the menu
extensions/export/cards...
