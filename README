# Inkcards

Inkcards is an Inkscape extension to create a deck of cards from a single SVG.
The required SVG size is the same as A card single card from the deck. By
activating some layers, the card shows (in Inkscape) and by activating others,
it show another card. The cards layers are described in inkcards.conf. Once all
cards are drawn and you are ready to print them, I suggest to work with SCons
to generate one SVG for each card you could then use countersheet or montage
to tile the cards into a PDF.

## Install

To install Inkcards, the files cards.ink andd cards.py should be copied into the
Inkscape extension dir (on Ubuntu: ~/.config/inkscape/extensions). The extension
should then (upon restart) be available in the menu
extensions/Boardgames/cards...

The rest of the files are a template (more than a template) to build the cards
with SCons and thus should be used as part of your project.

## Advantage

Suppose you are creating a medieval game, where you have some type of cards
like:

- Ennemie
- Spell
- Tresure

You can then create a layer for the deck, one per card type and one per card.
Modifying a single layer would then affect all cards that uses it.

## How to create :flower_playing_cards: :spades: :hearts: :clubs: :diamonds:

See how to print cards on [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/490643/making-cards-youll-never-use-your-old-method-again).
The CountersheetExtension should be used to tile the cards so you create a
printable file. I thought and tryed of using image magick montage, but I
finally looked more into Countersheet and it seams to have the same purpose and
is able to load external SVG file like is generated with Inkcards.

We could learn with countersheet how to edit the text in a card and add a
configuration option to have the text modified. So we could set the text for a
card in the config file.
